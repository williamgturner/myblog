    <p>
      this is a small python app I made to help visualise different algorithms.
      There are a selection of sorting and searchign algorithms for the user to
      select and learn about. I chose to create algoVis as a way to practise
      building GUIs, and to solidify my knowledge of these algorithms by
      implementing them and figuring out ways to visualise them intuitively. The
      graphs are generated by matplotlib, and CustomTKinter is used for the GUI.
