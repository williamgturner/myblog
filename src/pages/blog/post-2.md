i can't stand the likes of Tenet, and Inception walks a very fine line for me — but Primer is something else.
<br>
<br>
made on a shoestring budget and acted by director Shane Carruth's friends and family, Carruth wrote and produced a mind-bending time-travel film grounded firmly in reality. the props are made of everyday items, there are no special effects, and the dialogue is fast-paced and believable — the characters talk to each other, not to the audience.
<br>
<br>
while immersive and compelling, these realistic conversations come at a cost: there's a resounding lack of exposition, and you will get lost.
<br>
<br>
i can accept this, though — because thanks to Carruth’s meticulous writing, it **is** possible to understand. this is where Tenet lost me. walking out of the theatre, i felt the narrative had been engineered to be confusing, as if to showcase the director’s own intelligence.
